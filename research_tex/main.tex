	In this document, we will be discussing methods of obtaining a credible way of classifying difficulty in VSRG maps. We will first establish what makes a map difficult, then we build from there!
	
\part{Difficulty}
	What makes a map difficult, what is a difficult map? Could it be the following?
	The map was difficult because of ...
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Failing
	\item Combo Breaks
	\item High Stamina Requirement
	\item Low Accuracy
\end{enumerate}
We discuss all of these scenarios and we will choose one to tackle, possibly integrate the other options into our calculations in the future.

\section{Failing}

The most significant way that we can readily control if players fail is via \textbf{Health Drain} in which most VSRGs will implement. However, this value is inconsistent and will not provide useful information on higher \textbf{Health Drain} values due to lack of players passing certain maps.

\section{Combo Breaks}

Combo Breaks analysis is another method that isn't consistent, whereby "chokes" can be random and combo breaks mainly can only determine the \textbf{hardest} points on the map, it doesn't depict a difficulty cure.

\section{Stamina}

While stamina is a good way to look at difficulty, it can readily be derived from accuracy, which is conveniently what we'll be looking at next

\section{Accuracy}

This is the best way to look at difficulty, because not only it gives us a figure, it tells us the story and correlation between \textbf{accuracy} and \textbf{patterning}
