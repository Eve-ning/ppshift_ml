\section{Creating a Neural Network}

Before we dive into creating a neural network to finalize the calculation, we need to define specifically these few things:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Input
	\item Output
	\item Layers
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Input} Our input will be simply the $difficulty$ (matrix/2D vector), with 2 values, $reading$ and $strain$.

\paragraph{Output} The output will be the expected $accuracy$, which is gathered from the replays.

\paragraph{Layers} The amount and neurons of layers we use will be a hyperparameter. We will assign a value for those later
