\section{Creating a Neural Network}

Before we dive into creating a neural network to finalize the calculation, we need to define specifically these few things:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Input
	\item Layers
	\item Output
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What is our input?}

Our input will be simply the $difficulty$ (matrix/2D vector).
