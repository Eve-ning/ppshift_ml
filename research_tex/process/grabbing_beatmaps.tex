\section{Grabbing Beatmaps}

\subsection{Beatmap Downloading}

In this study we will only look at maps where $ Star Rating \leq 3.0 $. Any maps below this $Star Rating$ will usually only have \textbf{SS} scores, which will prove to be redundant in analysis.

\paragraph{osu!API GET beatmaps} Using this, we can find out the IDs of the maps to download.

\subsubsection{Downloading through web crawling}

Using python, we can download $.osu$ (osu! difficulty file extension) using the format below with authentication:

$$https://osu.ppy.sh/osu/<beatmap\_id>$$

We save all of these using $<beatmap\_id>.osu$ file naming system.

All $.osu$ will be converted to $.acd$. The action format is the same idea, where we have a list of offset and action.
