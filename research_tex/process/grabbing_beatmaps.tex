\section{Grabbing Beatmaps}

\subsection{Beatmap Downloading}

In this study we will only look at maps where $ Star Rating \leq 3.0 $. Any maps below this $Star Rating$ will usually only have \textbf{SS} scores, which will prove to be redundant in analysis.

\paragraph{osu!API GET beatmaps} Using this, we can find out the IDs of the maps to download.

\subsubsection{Downloading through web crawling}

Using python, we can download $.osu$ (osu! difficulty file extension) using the format below with authentication:

$$https://osu.ppy.sh/osu/<beatmap\_id>$$

We save all of these using $<beatmap\_id>.osu$ file naming system.

\subsection{Beatmap Validation}

We should note that maps with \textbf{variable scroll speeds} will cause anomalies in our calculation, so we need to further define what maps defy a threshold we set to remove these from our calculations.

\paragraph{Scroll Speed Manipulation Threshold}
A simple way of tackling this issue would be to skip all beatmaps that has any of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Any \textbf{slight} SV Change $ 0.97 \leq TP_{SV} \leq 1.03 $
	\item Any BPM Change
\end{enumerate}

After skipping beatmaps, we will grab all remaining $.osu$ and convert them to $.acd$. The action format is the same idea, where we have a list of offset and action.
